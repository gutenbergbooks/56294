<h2 class="lsp2">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of
this desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds
with which the Military History of our country abounds.
To hold forth these bright examples to the imitation of the
youthful soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the
meritorious conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have given
rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the "London Gazette," from whence they are
transferred into the public prints: the achievements of our
armies are thus made known at the time of their occurrence,
and receive the tribute of praise and admiration to which
they are entitled. On extraordinary occasions, the Houses
of Parliament have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks for
their skill and bravery, and these testimonials, confirmed by
the high honour of their Sovereign's Approbation, constitute
the reward which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular
records of their services and achievements. Hence some
difficulty has been experienced in obtaining, particularly
from the old Regiments, an authentic account of their origin
and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its
services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will
henceforth derive information as to the difficulties and
privations which chequer the career of those who embrace
the military profession. In Great Britain, where so large a
number of persons are devoted to the active concerns of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and where these
pursuits have, for so long a period, been undisturbed by the
<em>presence of war</em>, which few other countries have escaped,
comparatively little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which, even
during peace, the British Troops are exposed in every part
of the globe, with little or no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the
agriculturist and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be
supposed not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the
soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the
sacrifice of valuable life, by which so many national benefits
are obtained and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and
endurance, have shone conspicuously under great and trying
difficulties; and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they
have effected debarkations in spite of the most formidable
opposition, and by the gallantry and steadiness with which
they have maintained their advantages against superior
numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant
exertions of the Corps employed; but the details of their
services, and of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully
given in the Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty's special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting
to military men of every rank, it is considered that they will
also afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in the
Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit de Corps</i>&mdash;an
attachment to every thing belonging to their Regiment;
to such persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps
cannot fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the
actions of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always
been of paramount interest with a brave and civilized people.
Great Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments
of danger and terror, have stood, "firm as the rocks
of their native shore;" and when half the World has been
arrayed against them, they have fought the battles of their
Country with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a
record of achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers,&mdash;our
fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory
of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds before us, will
certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their
respective Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which
have, from time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment,
as testifying the value and importance of its services,
will be faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up
in numerical succession.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January, 1715, King George I.
proceeded in state to St. Paul's Cathedral, to
return thanks for his peaceful accession to the
throne of Great Britain and Ireland; but in a
short time afterwards the tranquillity of the kingdom
was disturbed by the rash proceedings of
the adherents of the Stuart dynasty, who were
conspiring to elevate the Pretender to the throne,
in which they were abetted by the courts of
Louis XIV. of France and of other foreign potentates.
These proceedings occasioned the army
to be augmented, and in July, 1715, Brigadier-General
<span class="smcap">Phineas Bowles</span>,&mdash;a warm-hearted
loyalist, distinguished for his attachment to the
house of Hanover,&mdash;who had acquired a reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
at the head of a regiment in the war of the
Spanish succession, was commissioned to raise a
corps of cavalry in the counties of Berks, Bucks,
and Hants, having his general rendezvous at
Reading.</p>

<p>His Majesty's appeal to his subjects was
cheerfully responded to, and a number of loyalists
coming forward to hazard their lives in defence of
their King and constitution, Brigadier-General
Bowles was soon at the head of a regiment of six
troops, which, having been continued in the service
to the present time, now bears the title of
<span class="smcap">The Twelfth, or the Prince of Wales's,
Royal Regiment of Lancers</span>.</p>

<p>The following officers were appointed to commissions
in the regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>While the regiment was in quarters in Berkshire,
the Pretender's standard was raised in
Scotland by the Earl of Mar; but this rebellion
was suppressed without Brigadier-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Bowles</span>'s dragoons being required to proceed to
the north; in October they escorted a number of
state prisoners to London, who were tried, and
several of them executed for endeavouring to
excite the people to rebellion, and for enlisting
men for the Pretender's service.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1716<br />1717<br />1718</div>

<p>In 1716 the regiment was stationed in
Gloucestershire; in 1717 in Wiltshire; and in
October, 1718, it marched to Bristol, where it
embarked for Ireland, to replace a regiment of
dragoons ordered to be disbanded in that country.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons were placed upon the
Irish establishment, and they remained in that
part of the United Kingdom during the following
seventy-five years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1719<br />1735<br />1739<br />1740</div>

<p>Brigadier-General Bowles was removed in
March, 1719, to the Eighth Dragoons, and was
succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>, by
Lieut.-Colonel Phineas Bowles. This officer was
promoted to the rank of brigadier-general in
1735; to that of major-general in 1739, and was
removed, in 1740, to the Seventh Horse, now
Sixth Dragoon Guards, when King George II.
conferred the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons
on Colonel Alexander Rose, from the Twentieth
Foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1743<br />1746</div>

<p>Colonel Rose commanded the regiment until
the summer of 1743, when he was succeeded by
Colonel Samuel Walter Whitshed, from the
Thirty-ninth Foot; and in April, 1746, Brigadier-General
Thomas Bligh was appointed to the colonelcy
of the regiment, from the Twentieth Foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747<br />1749</div>

<p>Brigadier-General Bligh was promoted to the
rank of major-general in 1747, and removed to
the Second Irish Horse, now Fifth Dragoon
Guards; and the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Dragoons was conferred on Major-General Sir
John Mordaunt, from the Eighteenth regiment
of Foot. This distinguished officer was promoted
to the Tenth Dragoons, in 1749, and was succeeded
by Major-General Lord George Sackville,
afterwards Viscount Sackville, from the Twentieth
regiment of Foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1750</div>

<p>On the 18th of January, 1750, Lord George
Sackville was promoted to the Third Irish Horse,
now Sixth Dragoon Guards; and the colonelcy of
the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons was conferred on Lieut.-Colonel
Sir John Whitefoord, Baronet, from the
Thirty-fifth Foot.</p>

<p>King George II. issued, on the 1st of July,
1751, a warrant regulating the clothing, standards

<p>Lieut.-General Sir John Whitefoord died in
1763; and was succeeded in the colonelcy by
Colonel Edward Harvey, from the lieut.-colonelcy
of the Sixth Dragoons. In the following year,
this officer was removed to the Third Irish Horse,
now Sixth Dragoon Guards, and the colonelcy of
the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons was conferred on Major-General
Benjamin Carpenter, from lieut.-colonel
of the second troop, now second regiment, of Life
Guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>Although the necessity for maintaining an
efficient military force in Ireland, had prevented
the regiment sharing in the perils and conflicts of
the war from 1741 to 1748, and from 1755 to 1762,
during which periods several corps had acquired
never-fading laurels, yet its excellent conduct during
its service in Ireland had been noticed and
appreciated; it was held in high estimation, and
in 1768, King George III. conferred upon it the
distinguished title of "<span class="smcap">The Prince of Wales's
Regiment</span>," in honor of the heir-apparent to the
throne, afterwards King George IV., who was
then in the seventh year of his age. At the same
time the arms, clothing, and equipment were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
changed, and it was constituted a corps of
"<span class="smcap">Light</span> Cavalry," and was designated "<span class="smcap">The
Twelfth, or The Prince of Wales's Regiment
of Light Dragoons</span>." The regiment was also
permitted to assume as a regimental badge, a
coronet, with three feathers, and the motto "<span class="smcap">Ich
Dien</span>;" also a rising sun, and a red dragon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770</div>

<p>Major-General Carpenter was removed to the
Fourth Dragoons in 1770, and was succeeded by
Major-General William Augustus Pitt, from the
lieut.-colonelcy of the Tenth Dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775<br />1782</div>

<p>After commanding the regiment five years,
Major-General Pitt was removed to the Third
Irish Horse, now Sixth Dragoon Guards, and was
succeeded by Lieut.-General the Honorable William
Keppel, from the Fourteenth Foot, who died
in 1782, when His Majesty appointed Lieut.-General
the Honorable George Lane Parker, from
the Twentieth Foot, to the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Prince of Wales's</span> Light Dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1784<br />1785</div>

<p>In 1784 the uniform was changed from
scarlet to <em>blue</em>, and in 1785 blue cloaks were
adopted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789</div>

<p>On the 25th June, 1789, Lieutenant the
<em>Honorable Arthur Wellesley</em>, now Field-Marshal
the Duke of Wellington, was removed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons from the Forty-first
Foot, and continued to belong to this regiment
until the 30th June, 1791.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1791</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Parker commanded the regiment
nine years, and dying in the autumn of
1791, was succeeded by Colonel Sir James
Steuart, Baronet, from the lieut.-colonelcy of
the Fifth Dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793<br />1794</div>

<p>The French revolution, which occurred at
this period, occasioned the regiment to be withdrawn
from Ireland, where it had been stationed
seventy-five years, and to be employed in more
active services. Although the King of France
was beheaded, and the republicans maintained
their authority by the terrors of the guillotine,
yet many patriots stood forward in the cause
of royalty, and the inhabitants of the celebrated
port of Toulon,&mdash;the principal station of the
French navy, delivered up their port and city
to Admiral Lord Hood, who took possession
in August, 1793, in the name of Louis XVII.
A French army advanced against Toulon, which
was defended by a few British, Spanish, Neapolitan,
and Sardinian troops; succours were sent
out, and the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons embarked
for the Mediterranean. Toulon was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
however, abandoned, and arrangements were
made for attacking the island of <em>Corsica</em>;
part of the regiment landed and was at the
taking of <em>Bastia</em>, which surrendered on the
22nd of May, 1794; and an assembly of
the deputies afterwards agreed to unite the
island to Great Britain. The remainder of the
regiment sailed to Italy, and landed at Civita
Vecchia,&mdash;a fortified sea-port in the bay of the
Tuscan sea,&mdash;and the conduct of the officers and
soldiers attracted the notice of Pope Pius VI.,
whose thanks were communicated by Cardinal
de Zelada, Secretary of State to His Holiness,
in the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">"<em>From the Vatican, May 30th, 1794.</em></p>

<p>"The marked consideration which the Holy
Father has always entertained, and never will
cease to entertain, for the generous and illustrious
English nation, induces him not to
neglect the opportunity of giving a proof of
it, which is now afforded by the stay of a
British regiment at Civita Vecchia. As his
holiness cannot but applaud the regular and
praiseworthy conduct of the troops in question,
he has determined to evince his entire satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
by presenting a gold medal to each
of the officers, including General Sir James
Steuart, Baronet, and Colonel Erskine<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, though
absent; and since these medals, twelve in
number, are not, at the present moment, in
readiness, nor can be provided before the
departure of the regiment from Civita Vecchia,
the Holy Father will be careful that they shall
be sent, as soon as possible, to Sir John Cox
Hippesly, who will be pleased to transmit
them to the respective officers, making them
acquainted, at the same time, with the feelings
by which His Holiness is animated, and with
the lively desire which he entertains of manifesting,
on all occasions, his unalterable
regard, whether it be towards the nation in
general, or towards every individual Englishman.
In thus making known to Sir John
Cox Hippesly, member of the British parliament,
the dispositions of the Supreme Pontiff,
the Cardinal de Zelada, Secretary of State,
begs leave to add an offer of his own services,
and the assurances of his distinguished esteem<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were withdrawn
from Italy and Corsica, and, sailing to
England, landed at Plymouth in January, 1795;
they were stationed, during the summer, at
Tavistock, and passed the winter at Nottingham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>In the summer of 1796 the regiment was
removed to Croydon, and in October to York.
The French republic was, in the mean time,
conspiring the destruction of British commerce,
and having concluded a treaty of peace with
Spain, had entered into negociations with the
Portuguese; but the Queen of Portugal refused
to ratify the treaty, and agreed to receive British
troops into several ports of Portugal. The
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were selected to
proceed to Portugal, to assist in the defence of
that kingdom, in the event of its being attacked
by France or her allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>The regiment left England during the winter,
arrived at Portugal in the beginning of 1797,
and was followed by the Twenty-sixth Dragoons,
the second battalion of the First (Royals),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and the Eighteenth, Fiftieth, and Fifty-first
regiments of foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800<br />1801</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were stationed
at Lisbon, where they remained until the winter
of 1800, when they embarked to join the expedition
under General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
destined to undertake the expulsion of the
French "Army of the East" from Egypt. The
regiment sailed under the convoy of the Braakel,
armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en flûte</i>, and arrived on the 11th of January,
1801, at the Bay of Marmorice, in Asiatic
Turkey, where the fleet was anchored in a
splendid basin of water, surrounded by mountains
covered with trees. The regiment landed,
and received a supply of Turkish horses, which
proved of so very inferior a description, that
the commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel Mervyn
Archdall, solicited to serve with the regiment
as infantry; the necessity of having a body
of mounted cavalry was, however, urgent, and
three hundred of the best of the horses were
trained<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; a number of men, however, remained
dismounted. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> and Twenty-sixth
Light Dragoons were formed in brigade under
Brigadier-General Finch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>From the Bay of Marmorice the fleet sailed
on the 23rd of February, and the greatness
of the armament, with the gaiety of the brave
men on board, was calculated to excite a deep
feeling of interest respecting the destiny of the
expedition, which involved the dearest interests
of Great Britain. The gallant troops employed
on this enterprise proved worthy of the confidence
reposed in them, and they more than
realized the expectations of their king and
country. Arriving off the celebrated city of
Alexandria in the beginning of March, the
fleet bore down into the Bay of Aboukir, and
on the 8th of that month, the troops landed,
and defeated a numerous body of cavalry,
infantry, and artillery, formed to oppose them.
Advancing towards <em>Alexandria</em>, the army encamped,
on the 12th of March, near Mandora
Tower, and on the following day marched
through a grove of date-trees, and drove the
enemy from a position he occupied. The
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons had one man and
four horses killed; one serjeant, and one private
soldier wounded.</p>

<p>After this success the army encamped, and
the Egyptian peasantry brought a supply of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sheep, goats, poultry, and eggs. On the 18th
of March, when a great part of the regiment
had left the camp to water the horses, information
arrived of the approach of a reconnoitring
party, and Lieut.-Colonel Archdall
collected sixty men, with whom he advanced
to meet the enemy, taking also a piquet of
twenty men. After proceeding about three
miles, he met one hundred and fifty French
hussars and infantry, under General D'Estin,
and, notwithstanding the disparity of numbers,
he instantly detached Lieutenant Levingston
with twelve men to attack the left flank of the
French hussars, while he charged the front
with the main body. Dashing furiously upon
his opponents, Colonel Archdall broke the
French infantry at the first onset; their cavalry
instantly fled, and the British troopers pursued,
killing and wounding several, but the main body
of the French hussars, being better mounted
than the British, escaped. The precaution of
securing the French infantry had been, inconsiderately,
omitted, and when the troopers returned
from the pursuit, they were fired upon
by the foot from behind a sandhill, which
occasioned some loss, and, finally, the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
infantry effected their retreat. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons had five horses killed; Lieut.-Colonel
Archdall, and one serjeant wounded;
Captain the Honorable Pierce Butler, Cornet
Earle Lindsay Daniel, and seven men, who
had been most eager in the pursuit, were
intercepted in their return, and made prisoners.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Archdall lost his arm, and
the command of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons devolved
on Lieut.-Colonel Robert Browne.</p>

<p>On the 21st of March the British repulsed
an attack of the French on their position; but
they had to lament the loss of Sir Ralph
Abercromby, who was mortally wounded. The
loss of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons was limited
to seven men wounded.</p>

<p>From the vicinity of Alexandria the regiment
afterwards traversed the country to Rosetta,
and advanced from thence along the banks
of the Nile, taking part in the operations by
which the French were forced to quit their
fortified post at <em>Rahmanie</em>, where the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
lost several men and horses.</p>

<p>While possession was being taken of the
fort of Rahmanie, Lieutenant Drake and thirty
men of the regiment went out to water their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
horses, and hearing a firing at a distance, they
proceeded to the spot, and found fifty men of
the Twenty-second French Dragoons skirmishing
with a party of Arabs. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> advanced
with the most determined gallantry,
but at the moment when they were about to
charge, the French captain held up a white
handkerchief, and agreed to surrender. An
aide-de-camp, with despatches, was also made
prisoner on this occasion.</p>

<p>From Rahmanie, the army advanced along
the banks of the Nile towards Cairo, and arrived
on the 16th of May at <em>Algam</em> and Nadir. On
the following morning some Bedouin Arabs
arrived at Colonel Browne's tent with information
that a body of French were in the Lybian
Desert; the colonel sent them to head-quarters,
and immediately despatched Lieutenant Francis
Raynes with a small detachment into the desert;
also ordered the light artillery and cavalry to feed
and water their horses, and be ready to move at
a moment's notice: Lieutenant Catson was afterwards
sent out with another small detachment to
keep up the communication with the first. Soon
afterwards Brigadier-General Doyle was directed
to enter the desert with his brigade of infantry,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> and Twenty-sixth Light Dragoons
(two hundred and fifty men) and some
artillery. At the same time Colonel Abercromby
and Major Wilson galloped forward to
find the enemy. After proceeding some distance
at a brisk trot the Light Dragoons came in sight
of the French column, which had been skirmishing
with the Arabs. The enemy was very
superior in numbers; the British artillery was
some distance in the rear, and the infantry was
not in sight; but Major Wilson advanced with a
white handkerchief on the point of his sword,
and proposed to the French commander, Colonel
Cavalier, to surrender on condition of being sent
to France, and the officers to retain their private
property. This was at first refused, but Colonel
Browne forming the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> and Twenty-sixth
Light Dragoons rank-entire, with extended files,
they presented a formidable appearance; and the
French officers and soldiers, being weary of
Egypt, and desirous of returning to France,
surrendered. This proved to be a valuable
French convoy of</p>

<ul>
<li>28 officers.</li>
<li>570 rank and file,</li>
<li>1 stand of colours,</li>
<li>1 light four-pounder,</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
    300 horses and dromedaries, and</li>
<li>500 camels.</li>
</ul>

<p>One hundred and twenty men of Bonaparte's
famous dromedary corps were among the prisoners,
and presented a grand and novel appearance;
and the horses and camels formed a
valuable acquisition to the British army.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General (afterwards Sir John) Doyle
expressed, in a letter to Colonel Browne, his
approbation of the excellent conduct of the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> and Twenty-sixth Light Dragoons,
adding,&mdash;"With such troops I shall always feel
a pride to serve; and at their head, be content
to fall, being convinced it must be with honor."
When this officer received supporters to his arms,
he chose, as one of them, a light dragoon of the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>, holding the French color taken with
the convoy.</p>

<p>The army, continuing to advance, arrived, on
the 8th of June, near the Pyramids, where it
halted several days, and subsequently advanced
to <em>Cairo</em>, and invested the city; the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons being posted on the left of the
river. In a few days the French surrendered the
capital of Egypt, which added additional lustre
to the British arms, and the brave soldiers, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
skill and valor gained these honors, were rewarded
with the approbation of their Sovereign,
and the thanks of Parliament.</p>

<p>From Cairo the army retired down the Nile,
and commenced the siege of <em>Alexandria</em>, which
city was surrendered in September, and the
deliverance of Egypt from the power of France
was thus completed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>On the evacuation of Egypt, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons returned to England, where they
arrived in 1802. The officers received each a
gold medal from the Grand Seignior, and the
regiment was subsequently honored with the
royal authority to bear on its guidons and appointments,
a "<span class="smcap">Sphynx</span>," with the word "<span class="smcap">Egypt</span>,"
as a mark of His Majesty's approbation of their
gallant services in the Egyptian campaign<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1803<br />1804</div>

<p>After their return from Egypt, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons were stationed at Weymouth
until the end of the year, when they proceeded to
Ireland, and the head-quarters were established
at Clonmel, from whence they were removed, in
1803, to Limerick, and in 1804, to Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805<br />1806<br />1807<br />1808</div>

<p>Returning to England in 1805, the regiment
was stationed at Guildford and Romford; in 1806
the head-quarters were at Blatchington, with
numerous detachments on the Sussex coast. In
1807 they were removed to Hythe, with detachments
on the coast of Kent. In 1808 the regiment
marched to Hounslow and Hampton Court,
and took the escort duty for the royal family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809<br />1810</div>

<p>The regiment was relieved from the escort
duty, in 1809, and embarked with the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to Holland under General the Earl of Chatham.
It was on board the fleet during the siege and
capture of Flushing on the island of <em>Walcheren</em>;
and when the object of the expedition was relinquished,
the regiment returned to England; the
head-quarters were established at Deal, with
detached troops along the coast of Kent, where
they were stationed in 1810.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In the spring of 1811 the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light
Dragoons received orders to hold themselves in
readiness to join the allied army commanded by
Lord Wellington, engaged in the glorious struggle
to effect the expulsion of the legions of Bonaparte
from Spain and Portugal; and six troops of
the regiment embarked at Portsmouth in May and
June. On the 11th of June Lieut.-Colonel Hon.
F. C. Ponsonby was appointed lieut.-colonel in the
regiment in succession to Major-General Robert
Browne. The regiment landed at Lisbon on the
25th of June, and, after a halt of ten days, advanced
up the country. The allied army retired, soon
afterwards, from its position on the Caya in the
Alentejo, and moved towards Ciudad Rodrigo; and
the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were formed in brigade
with the First (Royal) Dragoons under the
command of Major-General Slade. This brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was employed in the operations connected with the
blockade of <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, and with the action
at El Bodon, which took place when the armies
of Marshal Marmont and General Dorsenne
advanced to relieve the blockaded fortress. A
series of movements followed, in which the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> took part, and after the retrograde of
the French army, the brigade went into cantonments
in the valley of the Mondego, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
occupying Celerico.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>In the winter, when the siege of <em>Ciudad
Rodrigo</em> was undertaken, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light
Dragoons advanced to take part in covering the
operation, and were posted at Regarda, and on the
capture of fortress in January, 1812, they fell
back to Seixo, in the valley of Mondego, where
they were formed in brigade with the Fourteenth
and Sixteenth Light Dragoons, under the orders
of Major-General Anson.</p>

<p>In February the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons
marched to Thomar, where they remained until
the siege of <em>Badajoz</em> was undertaken, when they
proceeded to the Alentejo. On the approach of
the French army, they crossed the Guadiana
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and and advanced to'">and advanced to</ins> Los Santos, where they took
the outpost duty, and Badajoz was captured by
storm on the 6th of April. The covering army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
afterwards advanced towards the enemy, who fell
back, and on the 10th of April the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons drove the enemy's posts from the
vicinity of <em>Usagre</em>, and occupied the town. On
the following day the brigade, commanded on
this occasion by Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable
Frederick Ponsonby of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons,
moved towards <em>Llerena</em>, and kept the
attention of a large body of French cavalry
engaged by skirmishing, while the Fifth Dragoon
Guards, and Third and Fourth Dragoons, commanded
by Major-General Le Marchant, passed
secretly at the back of some heights, and gained
the enemy's flank. Everything succeeded according
to expectation; as three squadrons under
Lieut.-Colonel Ponsonby skirmished, the Fifth
Dragoon Guards issued from a grove of olive-trees
and charged the enemy's flank; and in the
next moment the light brigade charged the front
of the French line, which was instantly broken
and pursued for several miles. A hundred Frenchmen
were killed and wounded in the field, and a
much greater number, including one lieut.-colonel,
two captains, and a lieutenant, were made
prisoners. The loss of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light
Dragoons was limited to one serjeant, two private
soldiers, and one horse killed; one serjeant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
four private soldiers, and three horses wounded.
A cavalry order was issued on the following day,
from which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lieut.-General Sir Stapleton Cotton begs
Major-General Le Marchant and the Honorable
Lieut.-Colonel Ponsonby will accept his best
thanks for the gallant and judicious manner in
which they commanded their brigades yesterday,
and he requests they will make known to the
officers commanding regiments the lieut.-general's
high approbation of their conduct, as well
as of the zeal and attention displayed by all
ranks. The order which was observed by the
troops in pursuing the enemy, and the quickness
with which they formed after every attack, does
infinite credit to the commanding officers, and
is a convincing proof of the good discipline of
the several regiments."</p>

<p>The French army under Marshal Soult retired;
but another army under Marshal Marmont
had entered Portugal, and Major-General Anson's
brigade left Spanish Estremadura, and marched
for the province of Beira. Marshal Marmont
retired; and the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons,
having halted a short period at Castello-Branco,
were afterwards removed to Cano.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In June, when the army took the field, the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons proceeded to the vicinity
of Ciudad Rodrigo, and subsequently advanced
upon <em>Salamanca</em>, from whence the French
were driven; the regiment, having crossed
the Tormes below that city, with the column
under Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Picton, advanced,
by St. Christoval, along the road to
Toro, and after skirmishing with the French rear-guard,
took the outposts in front of St. Christoval,
where the army was placed in position during the
siege of the forts.</p>

<p>After the capture of the forts at Salamanca,
the army advanced to the bank of the Douro,
and the French under Marshal Marmont were
posted on the opposite side of the river. In the
middle of July the French passed the Douro,
when Lord Wellington united his centre and left
on the Guarena; but caused two divisions, and
Major-General Anson's brigade of cavalry, to
halt at <em>Castrejon</em>, on the Trabancos, under Lieut.-General
Sir Stapleton Cotton. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons arrived at Castrejon on the 17th
of July, and in the evening the piquet under
Captain Dickens was attacked. On the following
morning at day-break, the out-posts were driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in, and the French appeared in great force; the
cavalry formed in front of the infantry, but
afterwards advanced towards the river and some
sharp skirmishing occurred. Lord Wellington
arriving, the whole were directed to retire behind
the Guarena, which was executed with little loss.
The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons had five rank and
file, and eight horses killed; Adjutant Getterick,
twelve rank and file, and four horses wounded;
one rank and file and three horses missing.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were actively
employed during the operations which followed
the retreat behind the Guarena, and on the 20th
of July, when the opposing armies were moving
parallel to each other, Captain Barton's squadron
suffered from a cannonade; this squadron furnished
the out-posts at night.</p>

<p>The army subsequently withdrew to the vicinity
of <em>Salamanca</em>, where a general action was
fought on the 22nd of July. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons were stationed on the left, and
not far from the rocky Arapiles, and they had the
honor of taking part in the overthrow of the
French army. The regiment charged twice in
the evening, and broke some French infantry,
after which a squadron under Captain Andrews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
moved to Huarte. Its loss was Captain Dickens,
one serjeant, one rank and file and one horse
killed; two rank and file and three horses
wounded.</p>

<p>On the day after the battle, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
joined the other regiments of the brigade, which
had been in pursuit of the enemy's rear-guard,
and following the French army in its retrograde
movement, arrived at the ancient city of Valladolid,
in Leon, on the 30th of July. The
pursuit was not continued; but the Marquis of
Wellington left a small force in the neighbourhood
of Valladolid, including the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light
Dragoons, and marched with the army to Madrid,
a distance of about one hundred miles.</p>

<p>When the allied army had left the vicinity of
the Douro, General Clauzel advanced with the
French troops which had been defeated at Salamanca,
and occupied Valladolid, and Major-General
Anson's brigade was withdrawn across
the Douro at Tudela in the middle of August,
when the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> had one man killed in a skirmish
with the French.</p>

<p>On the return of the army from Madrid, the
French retreated; the British moved forward,
and on the 7th of September the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Dragoons entered Valladolid, and skirmished with
the enemy's rear-guard when the bridge was
blown up.</p>

<p>Leaving Valladolid the French army retired
down the beautiful Pisuerga and Arlanzan valleys;
the allies followed, and the ground being favorable
for a retiring army, repeated skirmishes took
place, in which the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons
were engaged. Arriving at <em>Burgos</em>, the capital
of Old Castille, the army halted, and commenced
the siege of the castle; the cavalry being pushed
forward to <em>Monasterio</em>, where the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light
Dragoons had frequent skirmishes with parties of
the enemy.</p>

<p>The French army having been reinforced and
placed under the orders of General Souham,
advanced upon Burgos; and this circumstance,
with the movements of the forces under Joseph
Buonaparte and Marshal Soult, induced the British
commander to raise the siege of Burgos
castle, and to retire.</p>

<p>During the retreat from Burgos to Ciudad
Rodrigo, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were
actively employed in covering the rear, and they
had frequent rencontres with the French advance-guards,
on one of which occasions their commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
officer, Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable
Frederick Ponsonby, was wounded; Lieutenant
Taylor was also wounded; and the regiment had
several private soldiers and horses killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>After passing the Agueda the army went into
quarters; the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were
stationed at Oliveira de Condé; and from the
period they had taken the field in June, they
reckoned thirty-three skirmishes and one general
engagement, in which the regiment, or a portion
of it, had taken part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>In February, 1813, the regiment was removed
to St. Pedro de Sul, on the Vouga, and in April
to Agueda, between Coimbro and Oporto. In
the mean time arrangements were made for
opening the compaign, and in May, the British
cavalry of the left wing crossed the Douro, some
at Oporto, some at Lamega and other places, and
entered the mountainous district of the Tras-os-Montes;
they were followed by several divisions
of infantry, and by the pontoon train; the whole
under Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham. The
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons formed a part of this
force; they passed the Douro at Oporto, accompanied
this portion of the army in its difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
march through mountainous regions held to be
nearly impracticable even for small corps, and
forded the Esla at the end of May. The French,
finding their position turned, fell back without
hazarding a battle, and a series of retrograde
movements brought them behind the Ebro. The
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons followed close on the
rear of the retiring enemy, and moving towards
the sources of the Ebro, traversed those wild,
but beautiful, mountain-regions, through which
the Marquis of Wellington moved his numerous
columns to turn the position occupied by the
French, who fell back upon Vittoria. On the
18th of June, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons
overtook a French division, with which they
skirmished until a British column came up, when
the enemy retired.</p>

<p>The skilful and brilliant movements of the
British commander had forced the enemy back in
confusion from the banks of the Tormes to the
confines of the Pyrenees, in three weeks; and
this splendid success was followed by a great
victory in the valley of <em>Vittoria</em> on the 21st of
June, in the gaining of which the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons had the honor to take part.
They formed part of the left column under Lieut.-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Sir Thomas Graham, and supported the
attacks of the infantry and artillery on the right
of the enemy's positions at Abechuco and
Gamarra Major, and towards the close of the
action they crossed the little river Zadora, turned
the enemy's right, and cut off his retreat by the
Bayonne road. The loss of the regiment was
small, viz.:&mdash;Cornet Hammond and one man
killed, and three men wounded: its gallant bearing
throughout the action, and the zeal, spirit,
and activity evinced by the officers and men, were,
however, conspicuous, particularly in its movements
in the evening of that eventful day.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of June, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light
Dragoons were detached, with other forces under
Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham, by the pass
of Adrian to the district of Guipuscoa, in the
province of Biscay, and in the evening the head
of the column, having crossed the Mutiol mountain,
descended upon Segura. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
passed the night in the mountain, resumed the
march on the following day, and arrived in the
evening in the neighbourhood of <em>Villa Franca</em>, at
the moment when the rear-guard of General Foy's
division, which was escorting a valuable convoy
towards France, was entering the town. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
French took up a strong position, some sharp
fighting occurred, and eventually General Foy
fell back to <em>Tolosa</em>, from whence he was driven with
the loss of four hundred men killed and wounded;
but the convoy entered France in safety.</p>

<p>In the beginning of July, <em>St. Sebastian</em> was
besieged, and the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were
employed in covering the siege of that important
fortress. Towards the end of July, when Marshal
Soult advanced with a powerful army to drive the
allies from the Pyrenees and relieve the invested
fortresses, the siege of St. Sebastian was turned
into a blockade, and Major-General Anson's
brigade of cavalry was employed in keeping up
the communication through the mountains, between
the left and centre of the allied army. The
communication was interrupted on the 27th and
28th of July; but was renewed on the 29th, and
after much hard fighting in the mountains, the
French were driven back with loss. The siege of
St. Sebastian was then renewed, and the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons took post at Usurbil, from whence
a squadron was subsequently detached to Renterio
to furnish the out-posts in that direction. St.
Sebastian was taken by storm on the 31st of
August, and on the 9th of September the citadel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
surrendered. About this period Major-General
Vandeleur was appointed to the command of the
brigade of which the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons
formed part.</p>

<p>After the fall of St. Sebastian, the troops which
had been employed in the siege advanced to the
frontiers, and on the 7th of October the passage
of the <em>Bidassoa</em> was forced, and the army
entered France. Unprincipled aggression was
thus overtaken by retributive justice, and the
kingdom which had sent its legions to other
countries to ravage and devastate, became the
theatre of war. After the passage of the river,
the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons bivouacked on the
great road, with posts at Urogne.</p>

<p>Pampeluna having surrendered, a forward
movement was made on the 10th of November,
when the enemy's works on the river <em>Nivelle</em>
were attacked and forced. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> supported
the infantry, and lost several men and
horses from a cannonade to which they were
exposed. The river Nive was passed in the early
part of December; but the weather became so
severe as to confine the troops to their quarters,
and the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons returned to
Urogne, and took the out-post duty in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
St. Jean-de-Luz. The French army occupied a
strong camp at Bayonne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>When the severity of the weather abated, the
army was again put in motion; and in the second
week of February, 1814, the British commander
advanced against the enemy's left to draw Marshal
Soult's attention to that quarter, while the passage
of the <em>Adour</em> was effected, by the division under
Lieut.-General Sir John Hope, below Bayonne.
By a difficult night-march a body of troops
approached the river on the morning of the 23rd
of February; the artillery forced the French
flotilla to retire, and sixty men of the foot-guards
were rowed across in a pontoon; a raft was
formed, a hawser was stretched across, and six
hundred of the foot-guards, the fifth battalion
of the sixtieth regiment, and part of the
rocket-battery crossed, and repulsed the attack
of a French column from Bayonne. On the
24th a squadron of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons
crossed the Adour, the men in boats, and
the horses swam across the river. A British
flotilla afterwards arrived, a bridge of boats
was thrown across, and Bayonne was blockaded.</p>

<p>In the mean time important events had transpired
in various parts of Europe, and the gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
power of Bonaparte was reduced. A party
favorable to the Bourbon dynasty was known to
exist at <em>Bordeaux</em>, towards which city a body of
troops was detached under Sir William, now Lord,
Beresford. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons moved
by the old road across the Landes towards Bordeaux,
where they arrived on the 12th of March,
and the magistrates and city-guards displayed the
white cockade. The regiment was left at Bordeaux
under Lieut.-General the Earl of Dalhousie; it
furnished posts and patroles between the Garonne
and Dordogne. Two squadrons were subsequently
attached to part of the seventh division which
occupied La Réolles; and on the 7th of April,
a squadron commanded by Major Bridger,
crossed the Dordogne, with Lord Dalhousie,
and made a successful charge upon a body of
French infantry at <em>Etoliers</em>.</p>

<p>Hostilities were soon afterwards terminated
by the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty to
the throne of France. After reposing a short
time in quarters, the regiment commenced its
march through France to Calais, which was
performed in a month, and in the second week of
July it embarked for Dover, from whence it proceeded
to Hounslow, where it was reviewed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
His Royal Highness the Duke of York; it was
afterwards removed to Dorchester.</p>

<p>In closing the account of the services of the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons in the Peninsula, it is
worthy of being recorded, that the regiment
never had a piquet surprised, nor a patrole taken;
neither did any instance of desertion occur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>In February, 1815, the regiment marched to
Reading, in consequence of some disturbances in
Berkshire.</p>

<p>After commanding the regiment for twenty-three
years, General Sir James Steuart Denham,
Baronet, was removed to the Scots Greys, and
was succeeded by Lieut.-General Sir William
Payne, Baronet, from the Nineteenth Light Dragoons,
by commission dated the 12th of January,
1815.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, appreciating
the important services rendered by the
army during the war, conferred rewards for gallant
conduct on officers and corps; and the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were authorized to
bear on their guidons and appointments the word
"<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>," to commemorate their services in
Portugal, Spain, and the south of France, under
Field-Marshal His Grace the Duke of Wellington.
Their commanding officer, Colonel the Honorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
F. C. Ponsonby, was rewarded with a medal and
two clasps for the battles of Barrosa, Salamanca,
and Vittoria. Before these distinctions were all
conferred, the reappearance of Bonaparte in
France,&mdash;his re-assumption of the imperial dignity,&mdash;and
the flight of Louis XVIII. from Paris
to the Netherlands, occasioned a British army
once more to take the field against the legions of
the usurper.</p>

<p>Six troops of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons,
commanded by Colonel the Honorable F. C.
Ponsonby, embarked at Ramsgate, in the beginning
of April, 1815, leaving a depôt of two troops
in England, (which was subsequently augmented
to four,) and landing at Ostend, on the 3rd of
that month, advanced up the country; they were
formed in brigade with the Eleventh and Sixteenth
Light Dragoons, under Major-General Sir John
Ormsby Vandeleur. Soon after their arrival in
Flanders, they were reviewed by the Duke of
Wellington, who was pleased to express his
"approbation of their appearance; that he was
happy at having again under his orders, a corps
which had always been distinguished for its
gallantry and discipline, and he did not doubt,
should occasion offer, but it would continue to
deserve his good opinion; and he hoped every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
man would feel a pride in endeavouring to
maintain the reputation of the regiment."</p>

<p>When Bonaparte endeavoured, by a sudden
advance of his numerous legions, to interpose
between the British and Prussian armies, and
beat them in detail, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons
were suddenly ordered to march, on the morning
of the 16th of June, to Enghien, from whence
they continued their route, a great part of the
way at a trot, to <em>Quatre Bras</em>, where they arrived
at sunset, at the moment when the French troops,
under Marshal Ney, were withdrawing from the
contest. The regiment bivouacked on the ground
behind the field of battle, and furnished small
piquets along the front, in communication with
the infantry. On the following day, when the
army made a retrograde movement, to keep
up the communication with the Prussians, the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons withdrew by the lower
road, through the woods and open grounds,
passed the river Dyle, at a deep ford, below Genappe,
and took post on the left of the position,
in front of the village of <em>Waterloo</em>, where they
bivouacked in the open fields, and were exposed
to a heavy rain during the night.</p>

<p>On the following morning (18th June) two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
powerful armies confronted each other; each occupied
a range of heights of easy access, and a narrow
valley was between them. Both armies were
confident in their leader, and, as daylight appeared,
they prepared to engage in deadly conflict.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were formed
in column of squadrons, and posted in a pea-field,
above Papilot, a short distance from the left of the
fifth division, which formed the left of the British
infantry. Soon after mid-day Count D'Erlon's
corps attacked the British left, but was repulsed,
on which occasion a brilliant charge was made by
the Royals, Greys, and Inniskilling Dragoons.
One column of the enemy, on the extreme right
of the attacking force, had not been engaged, and
it continued to advance. Major-General Vandeleur
had proceeded, with part of his brigade, to
support the Royals, Greys, and Inniskilling Dragoons,
whilst re-forming after their charge; but
the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> remained on the left, and Colonel
Ponsonby, having authority to act discretionally,
resolved, notwithstanding the inferiority of his
numbers, to attack the French column with the
regiment. He formed the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> in open
column, cautioned the men "to be steady, and do
their duty," and led them forward over ploughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
ground, saturated with rain, to attack this formidable
column of infantry, which was supported
on the flank by lancers, and covered by the fire
of artillery from a rising ground in its rear. As
the French column crossed the valley between the
two armies, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> passed the hedge-row
occupied by the Highlanders, and descended the
rising ground on which the British line was formed,
exposed to the fire of the enemy's artillery, and
receiving a volley from the column of infantry, to
which the slope, the regiment was descending,
rendered it a conspicuous mark. As the regiment
moved forward, it gradually increased its
pace; the men were anxious to charge; but
Colonel Ponsonby, whose courage they admired,
and in whose talents they placed unlimited confidence,
restrained their ardour, that he might
maintain their compact formation, and reserve
the power of the horses for the critical moment.
When that moment arrived, he gave the word
"Charge." The French, dismayed by the heroic
bearing of the regiment, gave way, and the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> plunged at speed into the column,
broke its formation, and cut down the French
soldiers with a terrible carnage. The moment
the regiment had cut through the infantry, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
was stopped by the columns of reserve, and
charged by the lancers. Having succeeded in
the object of the charge, Colonel Ponsonby was
anxious to withdraw the regiment, and spare his
men, who were fighting against fearful odds; but
friends and foes were mixed in a confused <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span>;
the colonel fell, dangerously wounded, and the
regiment withdrew from the unequal contest.</p>

<p>After returning from the charge, the regiment
was re-formed under Captain (now Colonel)
Stawell; its loss had been severe; of the three
squadrons, which ten minutes before had gone
into action, one-third had fallen; it was found
necessary to tell off the regiment into two squadrons,
and the grief of the soldiers was great at the
absence of their colonel, of whose fate they were
ignorant<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Major James Paul Bridger, whose
charger was killed in the attack, procured another
horse, and assumed the command of the regiment.</p>

<p>The following account of the charge of the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>, and of his own sufferings, was afterwards
written by Colonel Ponsonby to satisfy the
inquiries of numerous friends:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>"I was stationed with my regiment (about
300 strong) at the extreme of the left wing, and
directed to act discretionally:&mdash;each of the
armies was drawn up on a gentle declivity, a
small valley lying between them.</p>

<p>"At one o'clock, observing, as I thought, unsteadiness
in a column of French infantry, which
was advancing <em>with an irregular fire</em>, I resolved
to charge them. As we were descending in a
gallop, we received from our own troops on the
right, a fire much more destructive than theirs,
they having begun long before it could take
effect, and slackening as we drew nearer; when
we were within fifty paces of them, they turned,
and much execution was done among them, as
we were followed by some Belgians, who had
remarked our success. But we had no sooner
passed through them, than we were attacked in
our turn, before we could form, by about 300
Polish lancers, who had come down to their
relief. The French artillery pouring in among
us a heavy fire of grape-shot, which, however,
killed three of their own for one of our men:
in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span>, I was disabled almost instantly in
both of my arms, and followed by a few of my
men, who were presently cut down (no quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
being asked or given), I was carried on by my
horse, till receiving a blow on my head from a
sabre, I was thrown senseless on my face to the
ground. Recovering, I raised myself a little to
look round, when a lancer, passing by, exclaimed
'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tu n'es pas mort, coquin</i>,' and struck his lance
through my back; my head dropped, the blood
gushed into my mouth, a difficulty of breathing
came on, and I thought all was over.</p>

<p>"Not long afterwards a tirailleur came up to
plunder me, threatening to take my life. I told
him that he might search me, directing him to
a small side-pocket, in which he found three
dollars, being all I had; he unloosed my stock
and tore open my waistcoat, then leaving me in
a very uneasy posture; and was no sooner gone,
than another came up for the same purpose;
but assuring him I had been plundered already,
he left me; when an officer, bringing on some
troops, (to which probably the tirailleurs belonged,)
and halting where I lay, stooped down
and addressed me saying, he feared I was badly
wounded: I replied that I was, and expressed a
wish to be removed into the rear: he said it was
against the order to remove even their own men,
but that if they gained the day, as they probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
would, (for he understood the Duke of
Wellington was killed, and that six of our battalions
had surrendered,) every attention in his
power should be shown me. I complained of
thirst, and he held his brandy-bottle to my lips,
directing one of his men to lay me straight on
my side, and place a knapsack under my head:
he then passed on into the action,&mdash;and I shall
never know to whose generosity I was indebted,
as I conceive, for my life,&mdash;of what rank he was
I cannot say; he wore a blue greatcoat. By
and by another tirailleur came and knelt and
fired over me, loading and firing many times,
and conversing with great gaiety all the while;
at last he ran off, saying, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vous serez bien aise
d'entendre que nous allons nous retirer; bon
jour, mon ami.</i>'</p>

<p>"While the battle continued in that part,
several of the wounded men and dead bodies
near me, were hit with the balls, which came
very thick in that place. Towards evening,
when the Prussians came, the continued roar of
the cannon along theirs and the British line,
growing louder and louder as they drew near,
was the finest thing I ever heard. It was dusk
when two squadrons of Prussian cavalry, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of them two deep, passed over me in full trot,
lifting me from the ground, and tumbling me
about cruelly; the clatter of their approach, and
the apprehensions it excited, maybe easily conceived;
had a gun come that way, it would have
done for me. The battle was then nearly over,
or removed to a distance&mdash;the cries and groans
of the wounded all around me, became every
instant more and more audible, succeeding to
the shouts, imprecations, outcries of '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive
l'Empereur!</i>' the discharges of musquetry and
cannon; now and then intervals of perfect
silence, which were worse than the noise;&mdash;I
thought the night would never end. Much
about this time, I found a soldier of the Royals
lying across my legs, who had probably crawled
thither in his agony; his weight, convulsive
motions, his noises, and the air issuing through
a wound in his side, distressed me greatly; the
latter circumstance most of all, as the case was
my own. It was not a dark night, and the
Prussians were wandering about to plunder;
(and the scene in Ferdinand, Count Fathom,
came into my mind, though no women, I believe,
were there,) several of them came and
looked at me, and passed on: at length, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
stopped to examine me. I told him, as well as
I could (for I could say but little in German),
that I was a British officer, and had been plundered
already; he did not desist, however, and
pulled me about roughly, before he left me.
About an hour before midnight, I saw a soldier
in an English uniform coming towards me; he
was, I suspect, on the same errand. He came
and looked in my face; I spoke instantly,
telling him who I was, and assuring him of a
reward, if he would remain by me. He said
that he belonged to the 40th regiment, but had
missed it. He released me from the dying man;
being unarmed, he took up a sword from the
ground, and stood over me, pacing backwards
and forwards.&mdash;At eight o'clock in the morning,
some English were seen at a distance; he
ran to them, and a messenger was sent off to
Hervey. A cart came for me. I was placed in
it, and carried to a farm-house, about a mile and
a half distant, and laid in the bed from which
poor Gordon, (as I understood afterwards,) had
been just carried out; the jolting of the cart,
and the difficulty of breathing, were very painful.
I had received seven wounds; a surgeon slept
in my room, and I was saved by continual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
bleeding, 120 ounces in two days, besides the
great loss of blood on the field<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>The regiment remained at its post on the left
until towards the close of the action, when the
head of a Prussian column had arrived at the field
of battle, the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons were then
removed from the left to the right of the allied
army; and, in the general charge, made in the
evening of this memorable day, they had the
honor of being one of the corps which led the
attack of the right wing; they passed over the
ground on which the struggle had taken place
between the French and English foot-guards,
which was covered with killed and wounded;
rushed upon the flanks of the enemy's broken
columns with distinguished gallantry, and completed
their rout and discomfiture. When the
French army was overthrown and driven from
the field, the regiment halted for the night. Its
loss was Captain Sandys, Lieutenant Bertie, Cornet
Lockhart, six serjeants, and thirty-seven rank
and file, killed; Colonel Ponsonby, Lieutenant
Dowbiggen, three serjeants, and fifty-five rank
and file, wounded.</p>

<p>The honor of bearing the word "<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>"
on their guidons and appointments was afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
conferred on the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons by
royal authority. Colonel the Honorable F. C.
Ponsonby and Major James Paul Bridger were
constituted companions of the Bath; Major Bridger
was promoted to the rank of lieut.-colonel, and
Captain Sampson Stawell to that of major; and
Serjeant-Major Carruthers was appointed to a
cornetcy. The following officers received silver
medals:&mdash;</p>

<p>Every non-commissioned officer and soldier
also received a silver medal, with the privilege of
reckoning two years' service for having been present
at this battle,&mdash;the greatest of past or present
times, and one which has increased the reputation
of the British arms.</p>

<p>Following the shattered remnant of the French
army in its flight, the regiment arrived in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
vicinity of Paris, and the submission of the capital
was followed by the restoration of the Bourbon
dynasty to the throne of France. The <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons bivouacked in the Champs Elysées,
and, having been reviewed by the Emperor
of Russia, King of Prussia, and other distinguished
personages, marched into cantonments in Normandy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>The regiment, having been selected to form
part of the army of occupation, was placed in
brigade with the Eighteenth Hussars under Major-General
Sir Hussey Vivian, and while stationed
at Fruges, it assembled on the memorable field of
Agincourt, where the Waterloo medals were presented
to the officers and soldiers. In May, 1816,
the regiment marched to Desvres, (Pas-de-Calais,)
where the depôt squadron joined from England,
and information was received, that His Royal
Highness the Prince Regent had approved of the
regiment being armed and equipped as a corps of
"<span class="smcap">Lancers</span>;" a detachment was, consequently,
sent to England to learn the use of the <span class="smcap">Lance</span>.</p>

<p>In October the regiment was reviewed, with
the British, Saxon, and Danish contingents of the
army of occupation, by their Royal Highnesses
the Dukes of Kent and Cambridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>As a further reward for its conduct on all
occasions, the royal authority was granted, in
March, 1817, for the regiment being styled the
"<span class="smcap">Twelfth, or Prince of Wales's, Royal
Lancers</span>." At the same time the color of the
facings was changed from yellow to scarlet, and
the lace from silver to gold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>In the autumn of this year the regiment was
reviewed, with the army of occupation, near
Valenciennes, by the King of Prussia and several
princes and nobles; and in the autumn of 1818
the Russian, British, Danish, Saxon, and
Hanoverian contingents, were reviewed by the
Emperor of Russia, King of Prussia, Prince of
Orange, and the Grand Dukes Constantine and
Michael.</p>

<p>After this review, the army of occupation was
withdrawn from France; the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Royal
Lancers embarked at Calais on the 10th of
November, landed at Dover on the following day,
and proceeded from thence to Chichester and
Arundel. At the end of November they marched
to Staines, and were on duty at the funeral of
Her Majesty Queen Charlotte. They subsequently
proceeded to Canterbury, and furnished detachments
to Hythe and Deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>On the 21st January, 1819, Captain Alexander
Barton was promoted, with other officers, to
the rank of major in the army, for distinguished
conduct in the field, while on service in the
Peninsula, upon the recommendation of Field-Marshal
the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>In the summer of 1819, the regiment was
removed to Hounslow and Hampton-court, and
was reviewed by His Royal Highness the Prince
Regent. In August, 1820, it embarked at Bristol
for Ireland, and after landing at Waterford,
the head-quarters were stationed at Cahir.</p>

<p>Colonel the Honorable F. C. Ponsonby
exchanged to the half-pay, and was succeeded
by Lieut.-Colonel T. W. Brotherton, who had
served with distinguished gallantry in the Fourteenth
Light Dragoons during the Peninsular
war, and who assumed the command of the
regiment in October of this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>From Cahir the regiment marched, in the
spring of 1821, to Dublin, where it was stationed
when King George IV. visited Ireland,
and took part in the duties required on that
occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822<br />1823<br />1824</div>

<p>After remaining at Dublin a year, the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Royal Lancers marched into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Connaught district, with their head-quarters at
Ballinrobe, from whence they were removed,
in May, 1823, to Cork; and in July, 1824,
the regiment embarked at Waterford for England,
landed at Bristol, and marched from thence to
Brighton and Chichester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>General Sir William Payne, Baronet, was
removed to the Third Dragoon Guards, and
was succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Royal Lancers by Major-General Sir Colquhoun
Grant, K.C.B., K.C.H., by commission dated
the 2nd of June, 1825.</p>

<p>In the summer of this year the regiment
marched to the vicinity of London, and was reviewed,
with the Household Brigade, First and
Second Dragoon Guards, Scots Greys, Seventh
Hussars, and a brigade of artillery, on Hounslow-heath,
on the 28th of June, by His Royal
Highness the Duke of York, who was accompanied
by the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>From London the regiment marched to
Coventry, Birmingham, and Abergavenny; and
in April, 1826, it was removed to Hounslow
and Hampton-court.</p>

<p>While the regiment was employed in the
escort duty, commotions took place in Portugal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
where a constitution had been conferred on the
people, which gave them privileges previously
unknown in that country; at the same time they
were menaced by an invasion from Spain. In
consequence of an application from the Portuguese
government, a body of British troops was
sent to Lisbon, and four troops of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Royal Lancers, commanded by Major Barton,
(Colonel Brotherton being on leave of absence,)
embarked at Portsmouth in December, and
landed at Lisbon in January, 1827.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>On the 22nd of January Major-General Sir
Colquhoun Grant was removed to the Fifteenth
Hussars, and the colonelcy of the regiment was
conferred on Major-General Sir Hussey Vivian,
K.C.B., G.C.H.</p>

<p>The two squadrons in Portugal were stationed
for several weeks at Belem, from whence they
marched to Alhandra, and Alverca, and one
troop was attached to the brigade of Foot Guards
at Cartaxo. They proceeded to Torres Novas
in March, retired to the vicinity of Lisbon in July,
and subsequently occupied the barracks at Luz.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Brotherton exchanged to the
half-pay, and was succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel
Stawell, who joined the service troops in Portugal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and assumed the command of the regiment
in September of this year at Luz.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>In these quarters the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Royal Lancers
remained until the spring of 1828, when the
British troops were withdrawn from Portugal; the
regiment embarked from Lisbon on the 12th of
March, landed at Ramsgate on the 26th, and
joined the depôt troops at Canterbury on the
following day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829</div>

<p>Leaving Canterbury in April, 1829, the regiment
commenced its march for Scotland, and
after short halts at London and York, arrived at
Piershill-barracks, Edinburgh, on the 12th of
May; one squadron being stationed at Glasgow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>In April, 1830, the regiment embarked at
Port Patrick for Ireland, landed at Donaghadee,
and marched from thence to Dublin.</p>

<p>In this year orders were received to resume
wearing scarlet clothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831<br />1832<br />1833</div>

<p>The head-quarters were removed to Newbridge
in June, 1831, to Cork in April, 1832,
and in the spring of 1833 the regiment marched
to Dublin, where it embarked for England; it
landed at Liverpool in the middle of April, and
proceeded from thence to Manchester.</p>

<p>Previous to the embarkation of the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
from Dublin, a dinner was given, at the Royal
Hospital, to the whole of the non-commissioned
officers and privates, and to their wives and
children, by their colonel, Lieut.-General <span class="smcap">Sir
Hussey Vivian</span>, Baronet, who was then commander
of the forces in Ireland, as a testimony of
his approbation of the good conduct and efficient
services of the regiment. On his advancement
to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Lord Vivian</span>, in 1841, he chose
for one of his supporters "A bay horse,
guardant, caparisoned, thereon mounted a Lancer
of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>, or Prince of Wales's, Royal
Regiment of Lancers, habited, armed, and accoutred,
supporting his lance, proper."</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1834<br />1835<br />1836</div>

<p>From Manchester, the regiment marched in
May, 1834, to Birmingham; leaving this station
in April, 1835, it proceeded to Dorchester, and in
the spring of 1836, to Coventry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>On the removal of Lieut.-General Sir Hussey
Vivian to the Royal Dragoons, he was succeeded
in the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Royal Lancers
by Lieut.-General Sir Henry John Cumming,
K.C.H., by commission dated the 20th of
January, 1837.</p>

<p>From Coventry the regiment marched, in
May, 1837, to Hounslow.</p>

<p>On the 28th September the Twelfth Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Lancers, with the First Life Guards, and Grenadier
Guards, were reviewed by the Queen in the Home
Park, Windsor, being the first troops reviewed
by Her Majesty after her accession to the throne;
and on the 9th November the regiment had the
honor of escorting Her Majesty on her visit
to the City of London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>On the 28th of June, 1838, the regiment
was on duty at the coronation of Her Majesty
the Queen Victoria. It is a singular coincidence,
that three of the cavalry regiments, which attended
the coronation of Her Majesty, were commanded
by lieutenant-colonels who served together
in the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Light Dragoons at the
battle of Waterloo, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 9th of July the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Royal
Lancers were reviewed, with a number of other
corps, in Hyde Park by Her Majesty; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
subsequently marched to Brighton, where they
were stationed in 1839.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839</div>

<p>On the 28th December of this year, Colonel
His Royal Highness The Prince George of Cambridge,
was, by authority of Her Majesty, attached
to the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Royal Lancers, and
authorised to wear the uniform of the regiment.
The Prince joined in February, 1840, and continued
to do duty with the regiment for two
years<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1840</div>

<p>Leaving Brighton in June, 1840, the regiment
proceeded to Liverpool, where it embarked for
Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1841</div>

<p>The regiment has since continued in the
garrison of Dublin, and remains on that duty at
the period of the termination of this record.</p>

<p>The Historical Record of <span class="smcap">The Twelfth
Royal Lancers</span>, as given in the preceding
pages, which is confirmed by the testimony of
the highest military commanders, under whom the
regiment has served, sufficiently proves the value
of this corps to the crown, and that it has, on all
occasions, either in conflict with a foreign enemy,
or in patient endurance, when domestic disturbances
have required its services, fulfilled its
duties with honor, and with advantage to the
country.</p>

<p>The distinguished conduct of the regiment in
<span class="smcap">Egypt</span>; its gallant bearing and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
during the <span class="smcap">Peninsular War</span>; the noble and
daring charge made by the corps, on a column of
French infantry, at the battle of <span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>, on
the 18th of June, 1815, with the heroic manner
in which it led the attack of the right wing, at
the close of the action, have established the character
of the regiment, and proved its merit of
the honors which have been conferred on it by
royal authority.</p>

Frederick third earl of Besborough, was appointed cornet in the
Tenth Light Dragoons in 1800, and rose in 1803 to the rank of captain
in the same corps, from which he exchanged to the Sixteenth Light
Dragoons in 1806. In 1807 he was appointed major in the Twenty-third
Light Dragoons, at the head of which corps he distinguished
himself at the battle of Talavera in 1809; and in 1810 he was promoted
to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the regiment. In 1811 he
served under Lieutenant-General Graham, at Cadiz: and at the
battle of Barossa, in March of that year, he attacked, with a
squadron of German dragoons, the French cavalry covering the
retreat, overthrew them, took two guns, and even attempted, though
vainly, to sabre Rousseau's battalions. On the 11th of June, 1811,
he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Twelfth Light Dragoons,
at the head of which corps he served under Lord Wellington, and
distinguished himself, in April, 1812, at Llerena, in one of the most
brilliant cavalry actions during the war. At the battle of Salamanca
he charged the French infantry, broke his sword in the fight,
and his horse received several bayonet wounds. He repeatedly
evinced great judgment, penetration, and resolution in out-post duty,
and was wounded, in the retreat from Burgos, on the 13th of October,
1812. At the battle of Vittoria he again distinguished himself: his
services at Tolosa, St. Sebastian, and Nive were also conspicuous;
and, on the King's birth-day, in 1814, he was promoted to the rank of
colonel in the army. He commanded the Twelfth Light Dragoons at
the battle of Waterloo, where he led his regiment to the charge with
signal intrepidity. His services were rewarded with the following
marks of royal favour:&mdash;Knight companion of the order of the
Bath,&mdash;Knight grand cross of the order of St. Michael and St.
George,&mdash;Knight commander of the Hanoverian Guelphic order,&mdash;a
cross,&mdash;a Waterloo medal,&mdash;Knight of the Tower and
Sword of Portugal,&mdash;and Knight of Maria Theresa of Austria. In
1824 he was appointed inspecting field-officer in the Ionian islands;
in 1825 he was promoted to the rank of major-general; he was removed
to the staff at Malta, and retained the command of the troops
in that island until May, 1835, in which year he obtained the
colonelcy of the Eighty-sixth Regiment, from which he was removed
to the Royal Dragoons, in 1836. He was an ornament to his
profession. In him, great military talent was united with the most
chivalrous bravery,&mdash;calm judgment,&mdash;cool decision,&mdash;resolute action,&mdash;and
modest deportment. He died on the 11th of January, 1837.</p></div>

in the command of a regiment of foot, with which he
proceeded from Ireland to the relief of Barcelona, when
that fortress was besieged by the French and Spanish
forces under Philip, Duke of Anjou. He subsequently
served in Spain under Archduke Charles, afterwards
emperor of Germany; and his regiment distinguished
itself at the battle of Saragossa in 1710, but was surrounded,
and made prisoners in the mountains of
Castille in December following. At the peace of
Utrecht this regiment was disbanded, and he remained
unemployed until the summer of 1715, when he was
commissioned to raise a regiment of dragoons, now the

designed to make a descent on the coast of France,
with the view of causing a diversion in favour of the
army commanded by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in
Germany. The fleet sailed in the beginning of August,

coast of Brittany with the view of besieging St. Maloes,
but this being found impracticable, the troops, after
marching a short distance up the country, retired, and
re-embarked at the bay of St. Cas. The enemy advanced
in great numbers under the command of the
Duke of Aguillon, and attacking the rear of the British
army, occasioned great loss. Lieutenant-General Bligh
was much censured for his conduct on this occasion,
and soon after the return of the expedition, he retired
from the service.</p>


<p class="p1 smcap pfs100">Sir John Mordaunt, K.B.,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 22nd December, 1747</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Mordaunt</span> entered the army in August,
1721, and after a progressive service of several years he
was appointed captain and lieut.-colonel in the Third
Foot Guards. In January, 1741, he was promoted to
the colonelcy of the Fifty-eighth (now Forty-seventh)
Foot, and in June, 1745, he obtained the rank of
brigadier-general. He commanded a brigade of infantry
at the disastrous battle of Falkirk, fought on the 17th
of January, 1746, and his distinguished conduct was
commended by Lieut.-General Hawley, in his public
despatches. He also held an appointment in the army
commanded by His Royal Highness the Duke of
Cumberland, and was sent in pursuit of the rebels from
Stirling, with two regiments of dragoons and the
Campbell Highlanders. At the battle of Culloden he
commanded a brigade of infantry, and gained additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
reputation; and he also signalized himself at the
battle of Val in 1747. His meritorious conduct was
rewarded, in the autumn of the same year, with the
rank of major-general; he was also appointed colonel
of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons in December; and was
removed in July, 1749, to the Fourth Irish Horse (now
Seventh Dragoon Guards), and in November following
to the Tenth Dragoons. He was promoted to the rank
of lieut.-general in 1754, and to that of general in
1770. He was also rewarded with the dignity of a
knight companion of the most honorable military
order of the Bath, and the government of Berwick.
He died at Bevis-mount, near Southampton, on the 23rd
of October, 1780, at the age of eighty-three years.</p>


<p class="p1 smcap pfs100">The Honorable James Cholmondeley.,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 24th July, 1749</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Honorable James Cholmondeley</span>, third
son of George, second Earl of Cholmondeley, was
appointed guidon and major in the first troop, now first
regiment, of Life Guards, in 1725; in 1731 he was
promoted to the rank of lieutenant and lieut.-colonel in
the third troop of Life Guards; and in 1741 he obtained
the colonelcy of a newly-raised regiment, which
was numbered the Forty-ninth, now Forty-eighth, Foot,
from which he was removed in 1742, to the Thirty-fourth
regiment. Accompanying his regiment to
Flanders, in 1744, he served the campaign of that year
under Field-Marshal Wade. He was at the battle of
Fontenoy in 1745, and was afterwards promoted to the
rank of brigadier-general. On the breaking out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
rebellion in Scotland, he returned to England with a
brigade of infantry, and afterwards took the charge of
two battalions recently arrived from Ireland, with which
he joined the army in Yorkshire under Field-Marshal
Wade. On the flight of the rebels from Derby, he was
detached to Scotland, and signalised himself in a most
conspicuous manner at the battle of Falkirk on the
17th of January, 1746; but the excessive fatigue he
underwent, with continued exposure to severe weather,
deprived him of the use of his limbs for some time.
In 1747 he was promoted to the rank of major-general,
and was removed in 1749 to the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons.
In November of the same year he was removed to the
third Irish Horse, now Sixth Dragoon Guards, and in
1750, to the Sixth Dragoons. In 1754 he was promoted
to the rank of lieut.-general, and he was many years
lieut.-governor of Chester. He died in 1775.</p>


<p class="p1 smcap pfs100">Lord George Sackville,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 1st November, 1749</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord George Sackville</span>, youngest son of his
Grace the Duke of Dorset, choosing a military life,
entered the army in 1737, and was promoted to the
lieut.-colonelcy of the Twenty-eighth Foot in 1740. His
distinguished behaviour at the head of his regiment at
the battle of Dettingen, recommended him to the notice
of King George II., and his lordship was shortly afterwards
rewarded with the rank of colonel, and appointed
one of His Majesty's aides-de-camp. Continuing to
serve on the continent, he distinguished himself at the
battle of Fontenoy, where he was shot in the breast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
His lordship was also employed under the Duke of
Cumberland, in suppressing the rebellion in Scotland,
and was promoted, in 1746, to the colonelcy of the
Twentieth Foot. He served the campaigns of 1747 and
1748, on the continent; and was removed, in 1749, to
the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons, from which he was removed, in
1750, to the Third Irish Horse, or Carabineers; he was
also appointed secretary of state for Ireland. In 1757
he was removed to the Second Dragoon Guards,
and appointed lieut.-general of ordnance, and in 1758
he was sworn a member of the privy council. He was
second in command of the expedition to the coast of
France, under Charles Duke of Marlborough; also, second
in command of the troops sent to Germany; and,
after the Duke of Marlborough's decease, his lordship
was appointed commander-in-chief of the British troops
in Germany, under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick.
Owing to some misunderstanding with his serene highness
at the battle of Minden, his lordship returned to
England, and was, shortly afterwards, deprived of his
military employments. He was endowed with extraordinary
talents as a statesman, and he filled, subsequently
to this unpleasant affair, some of the highest offices in
the administration. He assumed, by act of parliament,
the surname of Germaine; and, in February, 1782, he
was elevated to the peerage by the titles of Baron Bolebrook,
and <span class="smcap">Viscount Sackville</span>. He died in 1785.</p>


<p class="p1 smcap pfs100">Sir John Whitefoord, Bart.,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Whitefoord</span>, of Blairquan, a Baronet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of Nova Scotia, having served in the subordinate commissions
several years, was promoted to the majority
of the Sixth Dragoons in 1743, and served with his
regiment in the Netherlands. He was subsequently
promoted to the lieut.-colonelcy of the Thirty-fifth Foot,
and in January, 1750, he was appointed colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons. He was promoted to the rank of
major-general in 1758, and to that of lieut.-general in
1760. He died at Edinburgh on the 1st of March, 1763.</p>

<p>This officer held a commission many years in the
Sixth Dragoons, with which corps he served at the
battles of Dettingen, Fontenoy, and Val. In 1754 he
was promoted to the lieut.-colonelcy of the regiment,
and proceeding to Germany in the summer of 1758, he
was present at nearly every general engagement and
skirmish in which British cavalry were employed, during
the remainder of the seven years' war, and on several
occasions he commanded a brigade of heavy dragoons:
he was twice wounded, viz.: at Wetter, in August, 1759,
where he surprised a French corps, and took many
prisoners, and at Campen, in October, 1760. In 1763
he was rewarded with the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Dragoons, and was removed, in the following year, to
the Third Irish Horse, or Carabineers. He was promoted
to the rank of major-general in 1762; to that of

in the second troop, now second regiment, of Life Guards,
in which corps he was appointed major in 1749, and
lieut.-colonel in 1757. He did not serve abroad, but he
was celebrated for a punctilious attention to all his duties,
and being repeatedly employed in attendance on the court
as ivory stick and silver stick in waiting, he obtained
the favour and approbation of King George II., and also
of King George III., who promoted him to the rank of
colonel, and appointed him aide-de-camp to the King,
in a few days after His Majesty's accession to the throne.
He was promoted to the rank of major-general in July,
1762, and two years after the King gave him the colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span> Dragoons, from which he was
removed in 1770, to the Fourth, the King's Own,
Dragoons. He was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general

died in 1788.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 24th October, 1770</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Augustus Pitt</span> was appointed in
February, 1744, cornet in the Tenth Dragoons, in which
corps he rose to the rank of lieut.-colonel; he commanded
the regiment in Germany, under Prince Ferdinand
of Brunswick, and distinguished himself on several
occasions, particularly at the battle of Campen, on the
15th of October, 1760, where he was wounded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>

<p class="p1 smcap pfs100">The Honorable William Keppel,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Honorable William Keppel</span>, fourth son

Lord Charles Manners in the colonelcy of the Fifty-sixth
foot, with which he embarked with the armament fitted
out against the Havannah, in the island of Cuba, having
the rank of major-general in the expedition. On the
surrender of the Havannah he took possession of fort
La Punta, and when his eldest brother, George, third
Earl of Albemarle, sailed for Europe, he was left in
command at the Havannah, which city he delivered to
the Spaniards after the conclusion of a treaty of peace
in 1763. In 1765 he was removed to the Fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

in 1773 he was commander-in-chief in Ireland;

<p class="p1 smcap pfs100">Sir James Steuart, Baronet,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 9th November, 1791</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">James Steuart</span> received a military education in
Germany, and at sixteen years of age King George III.
presented him with a cornetcy in the royal dragoons,
his commission bearing the date the 17th of March, 1761.
He served the campaign of that and the following year
with the regiment in Germany; was at the battles of
Kirch, Denkern and Groebenstein, and took part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
several skirmishes. In 1763 he purchased a company
in the Queen's royal highlanders, and that corps being
disbanded soon afterwards, he improved his knowledge
of the military profession by travelling in France and
Germany. In 1766 he purchased a troop in the second
Irish horse, now fifth dragoon guards; in 1769 he was
appointed aide-de-camp to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland
(Lord Townshend): and in 1772 he obtained the majority
of the thirteenth dragoons, from which he was
removed, in 1775, to the first Irish horse, now fourth
dragoon guards. In 1776, he was nominated to the
lieutenant-colonelcy of the thirteenth dragoons, and having
brought that regiment into an excellent state of discipline
and efficiency, he was rewarded with the rank of
colonel in 1782; in 1783 his regiment was constituted a
corps of light cavalry. In 1788 detachments from the cavalry
regiments in Ireland were assembled at Dublin, and
placed under his command, for the purpose of forming an
improved system of interior economy, discipline, and field
movements for the cavalry; his labours were honored with
the approbation of his sovereign, and his systems, particularly
his field movements, having been more completely
defined and arranged by Sir David Dundas,
were adopted for the cavalry. His services were rewarded
in 1791 with the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Twelfth</span>
Light Dragoons; and having been promoted to the rank
of major-general in 1793, he was placed on the staff of
Scotland, and appointed to superintend the formation
and discipline of the fencible cavalry in that country,
which was encamped under his orders in the summers
of 1795, 1796, and 1797. In the autumn of 1797 he
was promoted to the local rank of lieut.-general in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Ireland, and appointed to the command of the southern
district of that kingdom, which district was, by his
excellent arrangements, preserved during the rebellion
of 1798, in a state of tranquillity not known in any
other part of Ireland. He was rewarded with the rank
of lieut.-general, in June, 1798; and after the suppression
of the rebellion, he resigned his appointment on
the Irish staff. In 1803 he was promoted to the rank of
general; and in 1815 he obtained the colonelcy of the
Scots greys; he was also honored with the dignity of
knight grand cross of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic
Order. His rank and age prevented him from
participating in the active measures which led to the
wonderful military successes from the recommencement
of the war in 1803 to its termination in 1815. He
represented in parliament his native county (Lanark)
for many years; his mansion at Coltness was proverbial
as the seat of kindness and hospitality; and his time,
his talents, and his property, were dedicated to the
improvement of the district around him. For several
years he bore the sirname of Denham; but afterwards
discontinued it. He lived to be the eldest general and
the oldest soldier in the British army; and died at
Cheltenham, on the 5th of August, 1839, at the advanced
age of ninety-five.</p>

to Portugal with the local rank of lieutenant-general,
and served the campaign of that year under Sir Arthur
Wellesley. He took an active part in the operations
by which the French were driven from Oporto; and

captain in the ninth dragoons; and he was promoted to
the majority of the twenty-eighth light dragoons in
the following year. In 1802 he obtained the lieut.-colonelcy
of the seventy-second foot, which regiment
he commanded at the capture of the Cape of Good
Hope in 1806, and was wounded; "but the heroic
spirit of this officer was not subdued by his misfortune,
and he continued to lead his men to glory, as
long as an enemy was opposed to his Majesty's seventy-second
regiment<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>." In 1808 he exchanged to the
fifteenth, the King's Hussars. He commanded the
fifteenth in Spain in 1808, and highly distinguished
himself at Sahagun, where he was wounded, and he was
rewarded with a gold medal. In 1811 he was appointed
aide-de-camp to the Prince Regent, and promoted to
the rank of colonel. He embarked with his regiment
for the Peninsula in 1813; and commanded the hussar
brigade at the action at Morales, where he was wounded;
he also commanded the hussar brigade at the battle of
Vittoria, and was rewarded with an additional honorary

all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
